# Tools for finding text re-use

This is a set of scripts for …
* downloading and normalizing Latin texts from [“Corpus Corporum“](http://www.mlat.uzh.ch/MLS/) and collections of early-modern texts on Alexander Street ([Digital Library of the Catholic Reformation](https://search.alexanderstreet.com/dlcr) and [Digital Library of Classic Protestant Texts](https://search.alexanderstreet.com/tcpt)). The downloaded texts can be compared with [Similarity Texter](https://people.f4.htw-berlin.de/~weberwu/simtexter/app.html) or TRACER (see below).
* operating [TRACER](https://www.etrap.eu/research/tracer/) (cf. the [TRACER manual](https://tracer.gitbook.io/manual/)), a command line tool written in Java to search for all sorts of parallels between texts.
